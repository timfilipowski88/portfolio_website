# Portfolio Website

A Personal Web Development Portfolio Website

## Task
I built this project as a way to get my code and projects out there and to introduce myself to the coding community. 

## Criteria
My criteria for creating this project was to create something that showcased my ability to use HTML, CSS, Sass, and Vanilla JavaScript to created a simple, interactive website with a clear message of who I was, what I was trying to accomplish, and what I had to offer.

## Summary of Stack
I built the front-end of the website with HTML, CSS, and Javacsript. I specifically did not use any frameworks because I want to practice the fundamentals with this project. The framework skills are shown in my projects that are listed on the site. I needed to host this simply as it is my first launched, live website with a domain name so I chose Netlify and Namecheap to secure the hosting and domain.  

## Design
My design was meant to be simple and easy to navigate. I wanted to be direct as I was taught that a portfolio website being viewed by a recruiter is only viewed for a short time. 

## Run Locally
To run locally clone the repository to your current machine.
Go to the index file and open it with your browser.
To edit the Sass open the repository with a IDE and use your terminal to execute "npm run sass" , this will executed the node script to update your Sass changes.
